 # Important notes
 This case: A group of people can be accommodated in 3 large rooms that are consecutive
 and within the same row of rooms. It cannot be accommodated in single or
 double rooms.

 I couldn't finish the last case for reasons of time since it requires more logic but I managed to finish the other rules for now there is only the method that finds the consecutive rooms, however I need to make that order of consecutive rooms according to the number of groups of people to organize rooms dynamically
